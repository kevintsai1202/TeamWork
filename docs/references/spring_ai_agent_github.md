A [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/2.0-SNAPSHOT/index.html) library that brings [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude)-inspired tools and agent skills to your AI applications.

## Overview

[Permalink: Overview](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agent-utils#overview)

[![](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agent-utils/raw/main/spring-ai-agent-utils/docs/spring-ai-agent-utils-logo.png)](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agent-utils/blob/main/spring-ai-agent-utils/docs/spring-ai-agent-utils-logo.png)

Spring AI Agent Utils reimplements core Claude Code capabilities as Spring AI tools, enabling sophisticated agentic workflows with file operations, shell execution, web access, task management, and extensible agent skills.

This project demonstrates how to reverse-engineer and reimplement Claude Code's powerful features within the Spring AI ecosystem, making them available to Java developers building AI agents.

## Agentic Utils

[Permalink: Agentic Utils](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agent-utils#agentic-utils)

These are the agent tools needed to implement any agentic behavior

#### Core Tools

[Permalink: Core Tools](https://github.com/spring-ai-community/spring-ai-agent-utils#core-tools)

While these tools can be used standalone, truly agentic behavior emerges when they are combined. SkillsTool naturally pairs with FileSystemTools and ShellTools to execute domain-specific workflows. BraveWebSearchTool and SmartWebFetchTool provide your AI application with access to real-world information. TaskTools orchestrates complex operations by delegating to specialized sub-agents, each equipped with a tailored subset of these tools.

                    BraveWebSearchTool.builder(braveApiKey).build())

                // Task orchestration
                .defaultTools(TodoWriteTool.builder().build())
